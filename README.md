# Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm Simulator with Application to the Maximum Cut CSP.
The Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA) is a classical algorithm that enables the
mapping of the Max-Cut CSP to a probabilistic space, and solve it using an approximation method. The
goal of the PAOA is to best replicate the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
first introduced by Farhi et al. in 2014 https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028. By only replacing the quantum 
component of the QAOA, the PAOA serves as a quality control mechagnism when testing the effectivness of 
the QAOA.
