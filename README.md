The Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA) is a classical algorithm that enables the mapping of the
Max-Cut CSP to a probabilistic space, and solve it using an approximation method. The goal of the PAOA is to best replicate
the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), first introduced by Farhi et al. in 2014
https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028. By only replacing the quantum component of the QAOA, the PAOA serves as a quality control
mechagnism for the solutions of the QAOA.
